Why not automate your dating life?
Its pretty difficult to gain any sort of metrics on how well you're doing on Tinder
I mean, just try having a spreadsheet open while you swipe, insane!

Why not keep a record of all your tinder interactions and automate things as you go?
The goal of this project is to eventually automate swipping with machine learning and to gradually
improve it to the point where chattign is semi-automatic

Once a PoC is far enough for a demo I will update the documentation to show you how you can run your own
